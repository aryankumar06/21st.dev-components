## 2024-05-24 - Accessibility and Tooltips on Icon-Only Buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons must explicitly declare both `aria-label` (for screen readers) and `title` (for visual tooltips). In Shadcn/Lucide setups, icons don't inherently communicate their action to either assistive technologies or sighted users needing clarification. Missing these attributes is a common accessibility trap in dense UIs like habit trackers.
**Action:** Always add both `aria-label` and `title` attributes to icon-only buttons as a standard procedure to ensure an inclusive and intuitive user experience.

## 2026-08-09 - Empty States for Filtered Views
**Learning:** When implementing empty states for data-heavy components triggered by active filters or search queries, always include an actionable 'Clear filters/search' button to speed up user recovery and prevent dead-ends.
**Action:** Always include a 'Clear filters/search' button when an empty state is caused by active filters or search.

## 2024-05-24 - Accessibility of Hidden File Inputs
**Learning:** When hiding a file input (`display: none`), ensure the wrapping `<label>` is keyboard accessible by adding `tabIndex={0}`, an `onKeyDown` handler to trigger the upload via Enter/Space keys, and visible focus styling (`onFocus` / `onBlur`).
**Action:** Always make hidden file input wrappers keyboard accessible and provide visual focus states.
