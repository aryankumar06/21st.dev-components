## 2024-05-24 - Accessibility and Tooltips on Icon-Only Buttons
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons must explicitly declare both `aria-label` (for screen readers) and `title` (for visual tooltips). In Shadcn/Lucide setups, icons don't inherently communicate their action to either assistive technologies or sighted users needing clarification.
